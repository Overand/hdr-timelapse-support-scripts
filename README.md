Support Scripts for HDR & Timelapse fun
=============================

### Overview

These are some support scripts I started using in 2009 or earlier, to help ease the process of making time-lapse videos, and time-lapse HDR photos. These scripts are also used to help encode these videos, using ffmpeg and/or mencoder.

### Caveats

These scripts worked for me, and they may work for you, but they were written back when I knew even less than I do now.  They're ugly, the're kludgy, and they're potentiallt dangerous.  Read them carefully before running them!

### Release history

I'm going to start with a very simple upload of the scripts I've been able to track down readily, without comment or improvement.  There will certainly be some missing.
